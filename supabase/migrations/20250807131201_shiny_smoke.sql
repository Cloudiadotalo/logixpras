  # Fix RLS policy for leads table

  1. Security Changes
    - Add policy to allow anonymous users to insert leads
    - Keep existing policies for authenticated users
    - Maintain security while allowing public lead creation

  This migration fixes the "new row violates row-level security policy" error
  by allowing anonymous users to create leads, which is necessary for the
  public-facing lead capture functionality.
